# pricingStats
This function can be run from the command line in same directory the parseStats.py file is in:

These are examples of how to run the program:
python parseStats.py Data.txt -t1 2017-03-12T09:51:22Z 
or
python parseStats.py Data.txt -t1 2017-03-12T09:51:21Z -t2 2017-06-01T13:37:88Z

As for limitations of the code:
It assumes the data in the Data.txt file is formatted correctly.
I also assumed that the user will give it correctly formatted timestamps and give timestamps in order from oldest to newest.

Thank you for your time,
